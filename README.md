# NeuroAI Multi-Agent System

### AI-Powered Dataset Analysis & Project Planning Platform

## Overview

NeuroAI is a **multi-agent AI platform** designed to analyze datasets and automatically generate insights, project plans, and structured reports.

The system simulates a team of AI agents that collaborate to interpret data, analyze tools and projects, allocate employees, and generate a final report in **PDF format**.

This project was built as part of the **NeuraX 2.0 AIML Challenge**, where the objective is to create an **Autonomous AI Agent capable of converting client requirements into a development workflow**.

# Agents in the System

### Planner Agent

Responsible for interpreting the task and generating the **overall development workflow** for the project.

### Research Agent

Analyzes the **AI tools dataset** and evaluates technologies required for the system.

### Dataset Intelligence Agent

Processes datasets and extracts useful information.

### Data Analyst Agent

Performs deeper analysis such as:

* project clustering
* performance insights
* trend analysis

### Visualization Agent

Can be used for generating visual summaries of dataset insights.

### Code Interpreter Agent

Handles data processing logic and computations.

### Writer Agent

Combines insights from all agents into a structured response.

### Report Generator Agent

Creates a **PDF report** summarizing the final analysis.

# Supported Dataset Types

The system currently supports four types of inputs.

## 1. AI Tools Dataset

The system analyzes tools used in AI systems and assigns **quality ratings**.

Example Output:

* Large Language Models – Rating 9.5
* Vector Database / RAG – Rating 9.2
* SQL Database – Rating 8.8
* Redis Cache – Rating 8.5
* Docker / Kubernetes – Rating 8+

Purpose:
Identify the best technology stack for the AI system.

---

## 2. Project History Dataset

Projects are analyzed and grouped into clusters based on success metrics.

Clusters:
High Success Projects
Medium Complexity Projects
Rapid Development Projects

Insights include:

* success patterns
* team size impact
* recommended development strategies

---

## 3. Employees Dataset

Employees are analyzed based on experience, skills, and workload.

The system automatically generates a **project team allocation plan**.

Example:

Data Engineer → Employee_38
Machine Learning Engineer → Employee_368
Data Scientist → Employee_468
Backend Developer → Employee_416
Frontend Developer → Employee_72
DevOps Engineer → Employee_330

This ensures balanced workload distribution.

---

## 4. Requirement Document

When a client requirement document is provided, the AI agent generates a **complete development workflow**.

Example Workflow:

1. Data Collection → Data Engineer
2. NLP Model Training → ML Engineer
3. Knowledge Base Indexing → Data Scientist
4. API Development → Backend Developer
5. Chat Interface Development → Frontend Developer
6. Deployment & Monitoring → DevOps Engineer
